# hocit - the HOPE Code of conduct Incident Tracker

This project contains the software for the HOPE Code of Conduct
Incident Tracker, the software used by the HOPE Code of Conduct Team
to track incidents at HOPE.

## Goal

The goal of the project is to have a simple way for HOPE Code of
Conduct Volunteers to comunicate with attendees about Code of Conduct
related incidents at HOPE.

## Conceptual Overview

The idea behind hocit is very simple, if an incident occurs at HOPE,
it can be reported to the Code of Conduct team through one of a number
of incident reporting channels (described later). Once a report comes
in, it can be responded to by a Code of Conduct Team member. Either
one, or multiple reports may be linked to a single incident, and a
report may also link to several incidents (though we hope this is more
rare).

From there, information on the incident may be gathered, collected,
updated or eventually closed.
